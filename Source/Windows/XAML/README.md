DirChat XAML Files
=
These files are special xml files used to define all of the controls for a window or window system. DirChat uses these files so that the `Show-<windowname>.psm1` file for each window doesent get grossly large.

>You can safely ignore these if you aren't interested in the nitty-gritty window sizing and styling.

TL;DR;
-
>Just know that DirChat uses these files to draw the GUI for the application.
