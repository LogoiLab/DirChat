# DirChat
/dɪər//tʃæt/

DirChat is a "serverless" ad-hoc style messaging system.

  - No server!
  - Entirely portable.
  - Works like magic!

> The idea for this project was taken from a presentation about storing data in the Windows SAM file as GUIDs, the speaker noted that directory names can be used in a similar way. I no longer have a link...Sorry?

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Technologies

DirChat works thanks to the following:

* [Powershell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell) - Fully fledged dynamic language for automation and managment of Windows based systems.
* [PoshChat](https://github.com/proxb/PoshChat) - The "servered" version. (Thanks for the ideas)
* [Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) - Encoding directory names since DirChat was founded.
